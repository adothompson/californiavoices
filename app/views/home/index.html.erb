  <h3>Take One (May 21, 2008)</h3>
  <p>California Voices is an after-school digital storytelling program designed to guide students to have a greater commitment to academic achievement, career goals and civic engagement, while preserving the legacy of elders who have made significant contributions to culture, community, and country.</p>
  <p>Facilitators guide a group of 15-20 students, five hours per week in the art of finding compelling storytellers, conducting interviews, preparing research, scriptwriting, storyboarding, producing and editing video and music.</p>
  <p>At the conclusion of the school year, student teams have several well-crafted videos to present to their school and community, in addition to being included in the California Voices archive.</p>
